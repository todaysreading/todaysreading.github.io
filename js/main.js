        { date: '2025/4/30', reference: '1 Chronicles 29:11-12 (NKJV)', verse: "Yours, O Lord, is the greatness, The power and the glory, The victory and the majesty; For all that is in heaven and in earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, And You are exalted as head over all. Both riches and honor come from You, And You reign over all. In Your hand is power and might; In Your hand it is to make great And to give strength to all."  },
        { date: '2025/5/30', reference: 'Psalm 73:25-28  (NKJV)', verse: "Whom have I in heaven but You?  And there is none upon earth that I desire besides You.

For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls. You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin."  },
        { date: '2025/8/30', reference: 'I Peter 3:14-17 (NKJV)', verse: "But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. 'And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.'  But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed. For it is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil."  },
        { date: '2025/9/30', reference: 'I Peter 3:7 (NKJV)', verse: "Likewise you husbands, dwell with them with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered."  },

For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come."  },

And consider that this nation is Your people. And He said, 'My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.  Then he said to Him, 'If Your Presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here.' <br/><br/> The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse." },

For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.<br/><br/>But our God is in heaven; He does whatever He pleases. <br/><br/> I know that You can do everything, and that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You." },

        { date: '2024/6/30', reference: 'Colossians 3:18-19 & Eph. 2:1-5', verse: "Wives, submit to your own husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.  Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter toward them. <br/><br> And you He made alive who were dead in trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others.  But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)." },
        { date: '2024/7/30', reference: 'John 1:14 & Romans 3:23-24', verse: "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. <br/><br/> For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus." },
        { date: '2024/8/30', reference: 'Gal. 2:20 & John 10:27-28', verse: "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. <br/><br/> My sheep hear My voice, and I know them and they follow Me.  And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand." },

        { date: '2024/10/28', reference: 'Ephesians 1:3-6', verse: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He has made us accepted in the Beloved." },
